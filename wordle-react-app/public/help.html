    <h1>Wordle Pal</h1>
    Wordle Pal is an app to help you understand Wordle (and its
    cousins, Quordle and Sequence) and hopefully to help you play better.  

    <h2>Practice Mode</h2>
    There are five ways of using Wordle Pal, depending on what you
    are trying to do, each corresponding to one of the tabs across the
    top of the page.  The first tab is for Practice and it's just
    what it sounds like - you can practice Wordling or Quordling to
    your heart's content.  Select your puzzle mode (Wordle, Quordle or
    Sequence) in the upper right corner and start guessing.

    The responses for your guesses are either in the form of color
    coding of the letters in your word (orange means your letter is
    correct and in the right place, blue means the letter is correct
    but not in the right place) or else, in monochrome mode, using the
    old Mastermind coding system where a B (black peg) corresponds to
    "right in the right place" and a W (white peg) corresponds to
    (right but in the wrong place).  For people with vision issues,
    monochrome mode is probably going to be easier to use (and it
    takes up less space on your screen) but ordinary non-monochrome
    mode is closer to what most people are used to.



    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    The program is based on information theory and you can find a
    description of how it works in the slides from a presentation I
    gave at the Cox Automotive Product Group 2022 LevelUp conference.
